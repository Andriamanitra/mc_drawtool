Unfortunately I can't share the vanilla Minecraft textures for copyright reasons, but if you have the game you can extract them into this directory and use the provided `minecraft_1.16.json`. You can find the textures inside your minecraft.jar (use an archive manager to open or extract the file) in folder `/assets/minecraft/textures/block`.
